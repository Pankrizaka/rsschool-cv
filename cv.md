I graduated from the railway university, worked for 5 years as an engineer in the production and technical department. I was trained in trading in the Forex market, but it did not end well for my deposit.
I want to understand what IT is. I consider my ability to work hard and hard as my strength, and slow assimilation of new information as my weakness
No IT skills
English level A1
